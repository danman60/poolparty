## üß™ Example Playwright Test Snippets

```typescript
// Dashboard sorting test
await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
await page.click('button:has-text("TVL")');
const firstRow = await page.locator('tbody tr:first-child td:nth-child(3)').textContent();
await page.click('button:has-text("TVL")');
const newFirstRow = await page.locator('tbody tr:first-child td:nth-child(3)').textContent();
expect(firstRow).not.toBe(newFirstRow); // Sort direction changed

// Notification bell test
await page.click('[aria-label*="Notifications"]');
await expect(page.locator('text=Recent alerts')).toBeVisible();

// Watchlist test
await page.click('[aria-label*="Add to watchlist"]:first');
await page.reload();
await expect(page.locator('[aria-label*="Remove from watchlist"]:first')).toBeVisible();
```

## üéØ Focus Areas for "Messy" Assessment

Pay special attention to:
1. **Inconsistent UI patterns** (buttons styled differently, spacing varies)
2. **Confusing information architecture** (too much data, unclear hierarchy)
3. **Broken or janky animations** (stuttering, flashing, layout shifts)
4. **Poor mobile experience** (tiny tap targets, horizontal scroll)
5. **Unclear advisor guidance** (what does "Fair" vs "Good" mean?)
6. **Notification overload** (too many alerts, unclear priorities)
7. **Performance issues** (slow loading, laggy interactions)
8. **Accessibility problems** (keyboard nav broken, poor contrast)

---

## üìù Additional Notes

- The app uses **localStorage** for watchlist, notifications, and preferences
- The **Lifeguard system** is the core differentiator - test its helpfulness
- Pool names are **generated randomly** (e.g., "SoakingHog", "DancingFox")
- There's a **pre-push hook** that runs build validation
- Some features may require **wallet connection** (test with/without)
